> [!NOTE]
> This repository no longer hosts the latest release of spiralview as it has been integrated into [Knight Launcher](https://github.com/lucasluqui/KnightLauncher). Please [download Knight Launcher](https://github.com/lucasluqui/KnightLauncher/releases/latest) to use spiralview. You will only find the latest **source code** here, not releases.

Wrapper of various Three Rings editors for Spiral Knights.

spiralview relies on the [clyde](https://github.com/threerings/clyde) library to work, 99.9% of the work is done there, 
this is simply a wrapper for it with some minor quality of life changes and fixes for [Spiral Knights](https://spiralknights.com) in specific.
